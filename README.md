# Kanji „ÅÆ Study
### (You see what I did there?)

[Click here](https://mordyfier.github.io/kanji-app/)

A simple React app which displays the 2136 [J≈çy≈ç kanji](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/J%C5%8Dy%C5%8D_kanji). Clicking on each kanji card allows the user to hear the Google Text-to-Speech rendition of the default reading (although more/better functionality is coming ü§û).

### Aim?

Practicing React and API calls. The app utilizes the amazing [Kanji API](https://kanjiapi.dev) to procure the characters and the [Google Text-to-Speech API](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech) to provide the auditory result on each card click. 

In the future, I'd like to develop this into a studying aid/game which will allow the users to supplement their other modes of learning Japanese (I have found learning kanji to be one of the biggest bottlenecks).
