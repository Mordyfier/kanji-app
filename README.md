# Kanji の　Study
### (You see what I did there?)

A simple React app which displays the 2136 [Jōyō kanji](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/J%C5%8Dy%C5%8D_kanji). Clicking on each kanji card allows the user to hear the Google Text-to-Speech rendition of the default reading (although more/better functionality is coming 🤞).
